# Influence of deforestation on microclimatological conditions during a dry period in the mountain rain forest

The aim of this is to determine the microclimatological conditions along a land use gradient in the Andes mountain rain forest in South Ecuador in a height level of approximately 2000m using the observational data obtained at the two eddy-covariance stations. 

## Data

### In-situ measurement data 
Two Eddy Covariance Mesurement stations situated at apprx 2000m and providing data with a temporal resolution of 30 mins over the time period of the dry spell 2018-11-29 to 2018-12-05 with following parameters. 

Parameters : T, RH, SW_IN, SW_OUT, LW_IN, LW_OUT, ALB, LE, H, G, U, V, SWC, TS, TKE 

### Gridded data
ERA5_uv-rh500.nc including two time steps: daytime 12:00:00 and nighttime 00:00:00 The gridded data are ERA5 reanalysis data with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° by 0.25° (approximately dx = 30 km). This reanalysis data source is

## Workflow
- Calculating mean diurnal cycle of both study sites 
- Visualizing in an appropriate manner
- Identify similarities and differences in terms of microclimatic indicators, e.g. albedo, radiation budget, wind field dynamics, turbulences etc
- Analyzing the temporal evolution of the atmosphere and soil conditions using T / RH as well as TS / SWC
- Assigning the local conditions to the superordinate large-scale conditions
- Finding the differences and drivers behind those for both sites
