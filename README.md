# Python-Codes

I am an Environmentalist who loves to think about environment with logic and data. I am very much interested in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Geospatial Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Environmental Modelling and related topics.


I was born in Bangladesh, did my Bachelor in Textile Engineeirng, from BUTEX https://www.butex.edu.bd/ . I did a part time Masters afterwards while I was doing my first full time job back in Bangladesh at a textile factory. As soon as I completed my M.Sc in Envieonmental Science and Management from JU http://juniv.edu/department/env , I came to Germany at BTU Cottbus https://www.b-tu.de/en/ to study Masters in Environment and Resource Management. 


I am always happy to discuss and share. Knowledge is something that is meant to be shared. There is no use of knoeledge if not shared. Anyone is welcomed to study, learn, share and use these materials. I will be very happy to discover the fact that my materials at least inspired one single soul in thsi planet Earth.


Each moment is something new. Settle down and enjoy the nature. It will definitely take you somewhere.
In a world where you can take any side, take nature's.
