What is the influence of deforestation on microclimatological conditions during a dry period in the mountain rain forest?

The aim of this exercise is to determine the microclimatological conditions along a land use gradient in the Andes mountain rain forest in South Ecuador in a height level of approximately 2000m using the observational data obtained at the two eddy-covariance stations.
